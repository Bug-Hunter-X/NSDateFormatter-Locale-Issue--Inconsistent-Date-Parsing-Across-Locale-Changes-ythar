This code exhibits an uncommon Objective-C bug related to how `NSDateFormatter` handles time zones and locale settings.  The issue arises when the date formatter is created without explicitly specifying a locale, and the application's current locale is changed during its execution.  This can lead to inconsistent date parsing and formatting behavior.  Specifically, if a date is formatted using the formatter with one locale and then later parsed with the same formatter but a different locale, the resulting date may be incorrect.
